Completion Date: Dec 5, 2016

This is the repository for my completion of the freeCodeCamp "Build a Simon Game" project. Formatted for mobile use.

A working version is at https://codepen.io/cojamalo/pen/aBqXJY.

The project is an example of game logic coded using javascript and formatted with CSS. Allows user to play the classic Simon game in their browser!

Project coded by Connor Lenio - released into the public domain for educational purposes in 2017. SVG coded with Circulus.svg by Sara Soueidan. Slider code adapted from W3schools.com
